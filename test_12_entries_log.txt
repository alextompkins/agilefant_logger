commit 1951866ddb2fb42900cd6a67dd07c1a5d9deb661

    Refactored the View Medications page to use two list views & assorted buttons instead of the ControlsFX ListSelectionView.
    -Necessary because the ListSelectionView had no way to retrieve the selection model.
    -All previous functionality works (more cleanly too).
    -Delete button now works.
    -Can now only select in one of the two lists at a time.

    Fixed issues with pastMedications & currentMedications add listeners.
    Added deleteMedication button, but can't use it to delete anything yet because of the lack of ability to retrieved selected items from a ListSelectionView.

    -Changed Donor to store two lists of MedicationHistoryItems - one past and one current
    -Changed MedicationHistoryItem to use LocalDates instead of LocalDateTimes
    -Implemented a controlsfx ListSelectionView for the page itself.
