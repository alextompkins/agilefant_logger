    Cleaned up the Donor class somewhat:
    -Changed modified_on and created_on to createdTimestamp and modifiedTimestamp
    -Refactored getDonorOrganStatusString & getDonorOrgans (which were essentially the same thing)
    -Applied changes to method names to ViewDonorController & SearchDonorsController
    #fix #story[358] !task[a]
    
    Took 3 minutes
